    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/" target=_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard Markup langualge for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:<br>
        Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items<br>
        Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format<br>
        Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.<br>
        HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive.<br>
        So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.<br>
        In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.
